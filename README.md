============

Python script used to select the file types (through extensions) to copy
from one location to another.

The source and destinations dirs are prompted for and the user selects the file types while running the program.

Changes to make:
1. need to switch from easygui to Tkinter
2. find and delete all empty folders
3. convert it with py2exe so my Windows peeps can use it to copy files from the network
